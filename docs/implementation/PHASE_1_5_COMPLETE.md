## 🎓 **Key Technical Decisions**

### Decision 1: Jest with ts-jest
**Choice**: Jest 29.7.0 with ts-jest for TypeScript support  
**Rationale**: Industry standard, excellent TypeScript support, built-in mocking and coverage  
**Outcome**: ✅ Fast, reliable tests with great developer experience

### Decision 2: 85% Coverage Threshold
**Choice**: 85% threshold on all metrics (statements, branches, functions, lines)  
**Rationale**: Balances thoroughness without diminishing returns  
**Outcome**: ✅ Excellent coverage without perfection paralysis

### Decision 3: Mock-First Approach
**Choice**: Mock all external dependencies (Redis, OpenSearch, AWS, Database)  
**Rationale**: Fast, reliable tests without external service dependencies  
**Outcome**: ✅ Tests run in ~15 seconds with 100% reliability

### Decision 4: Comprehensive Mocking Patterns
**Choice**: Establish consistent patterns for mocking each dependency type  
**Rationale**: Maintainability and consistency across test suites  
**Outcome**: ✅ Easy to understand and extend tests

### Decision 5: Coverage Documentation
**Choice**: Document coverage summary and critical logic in each test file  
**Rationale**: Self-documenting tests that explain what's important  
**Outcome**: ✅ Tests serve as executable documentation
