# Figma AI Evaluation Framework

## üéØ **Purpose**
Evaluate Figma's AI-generated `.make` files that produce complete prototypes, focusing on AI design decisions, consistency, and alignment with specifications.

## ü§ñ **Understanding Figma AI (.make files)**

- Integrated component library creation
```

### **AI Design Approach vs Human Design**
```
Traditional Design Process:
- Manual component creation
- Iterative design decisions
- Human intuition and experience
- Contextual design choices
- Manual consistency checks

AI Design Process:
- Automated component generation
- Pattern-based design decisions
- AI training data influence
- Algorithm-driven choices
- Automated consistency application
```
