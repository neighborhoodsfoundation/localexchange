## 🚧 **Current Status**
- **Last Session**: Phase 1.2 Redis Cache & Queue System COMPLETED ✅
- **Next Priority**: Phase 1.3 - OpenSearch Integration
- **Development Environment**: Database and cache layers fully operational
- **Testing**: All Redis services tested and verified (100% test coverage)
- **Documentation**: Complete Redis setup and operational documentation

## 📋 **Next Steps (Phase 1.3 - OpenSearch Integration)**
1. **OpenSearch Setup**: Install and configure OpenSearch cluster
2. **Search Indexing**: Implement full-text search capabilities
3. **Advanced Filtering**: Set up complex search filters and sorting
4. **Search Analytics**: Implement search performance monitoring
5. **Integration Testing**: Test search functionality with existing systems

## 🏗️ **Architecture Decisions Made**
- **Monolith Design**: 8 specialized contexts (User, Item, Trading, Credits, Search, Policy, Admin, Worker)
- **Data Layer**: PostgreSQL (main), Redis (cache), OpenSearch (search), S3 (images)
- **Security**: JWT authentication, double-entry ledger, CPSC integration
- **Compliance**: App Store policies, GDPR, accessibility standards

## 🔧 **Development Environment**
- **OS**: Windows 10
- **Shell**: PowerShell
- **Git**: Configured with GitHub token authentication
- **Backup**: Automated backup system ready
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docs structure

## 📞 **Session Continuity Notes**
- **Last Chat**: Phase 1.2 Redis Cache & Queue System COMPLETE with full narrative documentation
- **Key Decisions**: Redis-based architecture with multi-database setup, Docker containerization, comprehensive testing, narrative documentation requirement
- **Completed**: Complete Redis infrastructure with cache, queue, rate limiting, session services, and comprehensive implementation narrative
- **Next**: Phase 1.3 OpenSearch Integration with same quality standards and narrative documentation
