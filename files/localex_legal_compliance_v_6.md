---

## 1. App Store / Play Store Compliance Overview

| Platform | Core Rule | How It Applies to LocalEx | Risk | Required Action |
|-----------|------------|---------------------------|------|-----------------|
| **Apple App Store (Section 3.1.1)** | Apple prohibits external or in-app payments for digital goods; allows off-platform payments for physical goods/services. | LocalEx facilitates **physical goods trades**; all payments are for **service fees** (escrow, safety verification). | ‚ö†Ô∏è Apple may misinterpret credits or escrow as digital currency. | Legal review of UI/wording; ensure credits are labeled as *non-redeemable barter tokens*. Avoid ‚Äúbuy,‚Äù ‚Äúsell,‚Äù or ‚Äúcash-out.‚Äù |
| **Google Play (Payments & Monetization Policy)** | Must use Play Billing for digital goods; off-platform payments allowed for physical goods or real-world services. | LocalEx exchanges **physical goods**; uses Stripe for processing service fees. | ‚ö†Ô∏è Google could classify $1.99 + 3.75% fees as digital service charges. | Include explicit disclosure in Play Store listing: ‚ÄúFacilitates in-person exchange of physical goods using Stripe for service fees.‚Äù |
| **Both Platforms** | Require accurate ToS, Privacy Policy, and disclosure of payment handling. | LocalEx has privacy-tiered design and escrow workflow. | ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing policies can cause rejection. | Publish ToS + Privacy Policy URLs before submission; reference Stripe and Coinbase in disclosures. |

---

## 2. Financial & Licensing Compliance

| Area | Current Coverage | Why It Matters | Action Required |
|------|------------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Money-Transmitter Laws (Federal & State)** | Likely exempt ‚Äì credits are closed-loop barter tokens. | Avoids classification as stored-value or virtual currency. | Obtain **opinion memo** from fintech counsel confirming exemption. |
| **Stripe Merchant of Record** | Fully covered (Stripe Connect Standard/Express). | Stripe carries PCI and AML obligations. | Confirm Stripe Connect setup (Standard or Express, not Custom). |
| **BTC Conversion (Coinbase Commerce)** | Non-custodial redirect flow. | Avoids crypto custody and FinCEN licensing. | Request **written confirmation** from Coinbase Commerce. |
| **PCI DSS** | SAQ-A compliant via Stripe tokenization. | Ensures card data never hits LocalEx servers. | Confirm SAQ-A scope in documentation. |
| **Refund Policy & Disputes** | Partial coverage via webhook logic. | Required for both app stores. | Add refund terms to ToS and payment handling documentation. |

## 3. Privacy, Security & Data Handling Compliance

| Regulation | LocalEx Readiness | Importance | Action |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|---------|
| **GDPR / CCPA / U.S. State Privacy Laws** | Tiered PII model (Tiers 1‚Äì3) already designed. | Legal requirement for user data protection and deletion. | Publish Privacy Policy referencing deletion/export rights and data retention windows. |
| **Children‚Äôs Online Privacy Protection (COPPA)** | Adults only implied. | Regulates under-18 user participation. | Add ‚ÄúUsers must be 18+‚Äù clause in ToS. |
| **Location Permissions (Google Play + iOS)** | Safe Zone requires location data. | Must justify foreground location usage. | Add disclosure: ‚ÄúLocation used to suggest safe meetup zones.‚Äù |
| **Photo & Identity Handling** | Escrow-gated access control already implemented. | Prevents privacy violations. | Include audit trail language in Privacy Policy. |

## 4. Required Legal Documents

| Document | Purpose | Owner | Notes |
|-----------|----------|--------|-------|
| **Terms of Service** | Defines trades, fees, disclaimers, Safe Zone liability limits. | Legal Counsel | Include sections for escrow, refunds, and user safety responsibility. |
| **Privacy Policy** | Describes data tiers, storage, retention, and user rights. | Legal Counsel | Required in both app store listings. |
| **Credits Policy Statement** | Defines credits as non-redeemable, non-transferable barter tokens. | Drafted internally, reviewed by counsel | Keeps LocalEx outside stored-value law. |
| **App Store & Play Store Listing Language** | Describes LocalEx as physical goods marketplace with Stripe integration. | Product + Legal | Avoid ‚Äúbuy/sell‚Äù terms; emphasize ‚Äútrade‚Äù and ‚Äúfacilitation.‚Äù |
| **Compliance Opinion (Money-Transmitter)** | Confirms exemption from licensing. | Fintech Attorney | Provides legal backing for investors and app stores. |

## 5. Risk Controls & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|--------------------|
| **Safe Zone liability** | Physical injury or theft risk. | Add disclaimer: ‚ÄúUsers responsible for own safety; meet only in verified Safe Zones.‚Äù |
| **User identity exposure** | Privacy breach potential. | Maintain escrow-gated photo access; log all views. |
| **Chargebacks or payment fraud** | Medium financial risk. | Use Stripe Radar + transaction velocity checks. |
| **Location misuse** | User tracking concerns. | Store ZIP + city only; never expose lat/lng externally. |

- Credits must not function as redeemable currency.

### Google Play Payments Policy Key Points

## 8. Appendix A ‚Äì Draft Credits Policy Language

> **Credits Policy (Proposed)**  
> LocalEx Credits are non-redeemable digital barter tokens used solely to facilitate value exchanges within the LocalEx platform. Credits **have no cash value**, are **non-transferable outside LocalEx**, and **cannot be converted into currency or withdrawn**. They serve as a closed-loop accounting unit to simplify user trades. All real-world payments (platform or marketplace fees) are processed via Stripe, a PCI Level 1 certified payment provider. LocalEx does not issue, store, or redeem fiat or cryptocurrency.  

---

## 9. Appendix B ‚Äì App Store & Google Play Compliance Summary

> **App Description Compliance Statement (Proposed)**  
> LocalEx is a community trading app that facilitates the **exchange of physical goods** between verified local users. The app uses **Stripe** for processing small service fees associated with escrow, safety verification, and platform operations. All goods exchanged occur **in person**, outside the app, at user-selected Safe Zones. LocalEx does **not** sell or deliver digital goods or services through the app and is therefore compliant with Apple App Store Section 3.1.1 and Google Play‚Äôs Payments Policy for physical goods.
