# AI-Generated Content Analysis

## üéØ **Purpose**
This directory contains AI-generated prototypes from Figma's AI tool, along with analysis and evaluation of the AI's design decisions against our specifications.

## üìÅ **Directory Structure**

### **make-files/**
- Original `.make` files from Figma AI
- AI generation parameters and settings
- Version history of AI-generated content

### **generated-screens/**
- AI-generated screen exports (PNG, SVG)
- Screen-by-screen analysis
- Specification compliance assessment

### **generated-components/**
- AI-generated component library
- Component analysis and evaluation
- Reusability and consistency assessment

### **generated-flows/**
- AI-generated user flow prototypes
- Flow logic and navigation analysis
- User experience evaluation

### **analysis-reports/**
- AI design decision analysis
- Specification compliance reports
- Human-AI collaboration recommendations

## üîç **AI Analysis Process**

### **Step 1: Import AI Output**
1. Copy `.make` file to `make-files/`
2. Generate prototype in Figma
3. Export screens to `generated-screens/`
4. Export components to `generated-components/`
5. Export flows to `generated-flows/`

### **Step 2: Run AI Analysis**
1. Use `FIGMA_AI_EVALUATION_FRAMEWORK.md`
2. Use `FIGMA_AI_MAKE_FILE_ANALYSIS.md`
3. Document AI design decisions
4. Assess specification compliance

### **Step 3: Generate Analysis Report**
1. Create analysis report in `analysis-reports/`
2. Document findings and recommendations
3. Plan human-AI collaboration approach
4. Set iteration goals

## üìä **Key Analysis Areas**

### **AI Design Decision Quality**
- Component selection and styling
- Layout and spacing decisions
- Color palette application
- Typography usage
- User flow logic

### **Specification Compliance**
- Currency toggle implementation
- Profile system completeness
- Brand guideline adherence
- Component specification alignment
- User experience requirements

### **AI Pattern Analysis**
- Design pattern consistency
- Component reuse effectiveness
- Scaling and responsive decisions
- Interaction pattern application
- Visual hierarchy maintenance

### **Human-AI Collaboration**
- AI strengths to leverage
- Areas needing human intervention
- Hybrid approach opportunities
- Iteration and improvement planning

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

1. **Import AI Output**: Copy your `.make` file and generate prototype
2. **Export Content**: Export screens, components, and flows
3. **Run Analysis**: Use the evaluation frameworks
4. **Document Findings**: Create comprehensive analysis report
5. **Plan Iteration**: Use insights to improve AI output

This systematic approach ensures thorough evaluation of AI-generated prototypes and effective human-AI collaboration for optimal design outcomes.
