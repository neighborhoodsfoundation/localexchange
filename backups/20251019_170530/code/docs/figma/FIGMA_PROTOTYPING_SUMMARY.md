## ðŸŽ¯ **Executive Summary**

LocalEx is ready to proceed with Figma prototyping to validate user experience before development begins. This approach will save significant development time and resources by identifying and fixing usability issues early in the design process.

### **Why Figma Prototyping?**
```
Benefits:
âœ… Fast to Build: 1-2 weeks vs 6-8 weeks for coded MVP
âœ… User Testing Ready: Interactive prototypes with real flows
âœ… Cost Effective: No development time wasted on wrong UX
âœ… Iteration Friendly: Easy to modify based on feedback
âœ… Stakeholder Buy-in: Visual demonstration of product vision

Risk Reduction:
- Identify usability issues before development
- Validate core user flows and navigation
- Test user comprehension of key features
- Gather feedback on design and functionality
- Reduce development risk through early validation
