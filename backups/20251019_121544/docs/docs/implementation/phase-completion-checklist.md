## Quality Gates

Before moving to the next phase, the following quality gates must be passed:

1. **Technical Gate**: All functionality working, tests passing, performance met
2. **Documentation Gate**: Complete documentation suite created and reviewed
3. **Security Gate**: Security measures implemented and validated
4. **Operational Gate**: Backup, monitoring, and support procedures ready
5. **Business Gate**: System ready for intended use case

## Review Process

Each phase completion requires:

1. **Technical Review**: Code review, testing validation, performance verification
2. **Documentation Review**: Completeness, accuracy, usability assessment
3. **Security Review**: Security measures validation, vulnerability assessment
4. **Operational Review**: Backup procedures, monitoring setup, support readiness
5. **Business Review**: Feature completeness, user experience, business value

## Sign-off Requirements

Phase completion requires sign-off from:

- **Technical Lead**: Technical implementation and testing
- **Security Lead**: Security measures and compliance
- **Operations Lead**: Backup, monitoring, and support procedures
