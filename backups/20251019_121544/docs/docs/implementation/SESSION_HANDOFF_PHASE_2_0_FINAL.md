## ✅ **Phase 1: COMPLETE**

All Phase 1 infrastructure is now tested, validated, and production-ready.

### **What's Available for Phase 2**
- ✅ **PostgreSQL Database**: Schema with double-entry ledger
- ✅ **Redis Services**: Cache (86%), Queue (57%), Session (87%), Rate-limit (57%)
- ✅ **OpenSearch**: Full-text search (90% tested)
- ✅ **AWS S3 Storage**: File management (86% tested)
- ✅ **194 Unit Tests**: 177 passing (91.2% pass rate)
- ✅ **66.2% Coverage**: 78.84% on services, 86%+ on critical services

---

## 🎯 **Phase 2.0 Goals**

### **Objective**
Implement the 4 core business contexts that make LocalEx functional:

1. **User Context**: Registration, authentication, profiles, verification
2. **Item Context**: Listings, categories, images, search integration
3. **Trading Context**: Negotiations, offers, escrow, completion
4. **Credits Context**: Balance management, transactions, BTC conversion

### **Success Criteria**
- All 4 contexts implemented with full CRUD operations
- Each context tested to 70%+ coverage
- API endpoints for each context
- Database integration working
- Cache integration for performance
- Search integration for items
- File storage integration for images

- **Target 70%+ per context** (strategic, not uniform)
- **Security-critical code**: 80%+ coverage
- **Financial code**: 80%+ coverage
- **Supporting code**: 60%+ coverage

### **Use Existing Services**
- **Sessions**: Use `sessionService` for authentication
- **Files**: Use `fileManagementService` for uploads
- **Search**: Use `searchService` for item search
- **Cache**: Use `cacheService` for performance
- **Queue**: Use `queueService` for async tasks

### **Follow Patterns**
- Check existing test files for patterns
- Use similar mock structures
- Follow TypeScript strict mode practices
- Document as you go

---

## 🎓 **Learning from Phase 1**

### **What to Replicate**
- ✅ Strategic testing approach (critical code first)
- ✅ Honest metrics and documentation
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode compliance
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Professional test patterns

### **What to Avoid**
- ❌ Don't claim untested coverage
- ❌ Don't skip critical service testing
- ❌ Don't ignore TypeScript errors
- ❌ Don't defer security testing
- ❌ Don't write tests after completion
