```

## üí∞ **PART 2: FINANCIAL & LICENSING COMPLIANCE**

- ‚úÖ Stripe handles all real money transactions
- ‚úÖ Closed-loop system (credits can't leave platform)

#### **Required Legal Opinion**
**Action Required:** Obtain written legal opinion from fintech attorney confirming exemption.

**Opinion Memo Template:**
```
SUBJECT: LocalEx Money Transmitter Exemption Analysis

LocalEx Credits are non-redeemable, non-transferable digital barter tokens 
used solely for internal platform accounting. They have no cash value, 
cannot be converted to currency, and cannot be withdrawn. All real 
money transactions are processed by Stripe (licensed money transmitter).

CONCLUSION: LocalEx is exempt from money transmitter licensing 
requirements under [specific state/federal exemptions].
```
