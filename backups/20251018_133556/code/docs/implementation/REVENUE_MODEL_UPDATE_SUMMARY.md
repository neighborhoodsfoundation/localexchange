## üö® **CRITICAL WARNINGS & REQUIRED ACTIONS**

### **1. App Store Compliance Risk**

**Issue**: Real money transactions for physical goods could violate Apple/Google policies

**Our Position**: 
- ‚úÖ We are **facilitating P2P trades**, NOT selling goods
- ‚úÖ Fees are for **platform service**, not goods themselves
- ‚úÖ Physical goods exception (like Uber, Airbnb, OfferUp, Mercari)

**REQUIRED ACTION**: 
- **Legal review BEFORE any payment code is written** ($2K-$5K cost)
- Position as "marketplace facilitator" not "merchant"
- Follow OfferUp/Mercari precedent

**Risk**: App rejection if non-compliant

---

### **2. Financial Regulations**

**Potential Requirements**:
- PCI-DSS Level 1 Compliance (‚úÖ **Stripe handles this**)
- Money Transmitter Licenses (‚ö†Ô∏è **Unclear - need consultant**)
- KYC/AML Compliance (depends on volume)

**REQUIRED ACTION**:
- **Financial compliance consultant** ($5K-$10K)
- Confirm money transmission license requirements
- Stripe likely handles compliance as merchant of record

**Risk**: Operating illegally without proper licenses

---

### **3. Payment Processor Costs**

**Stripe Fees**: 2.9% + $0.30 per charge

**Per Trade** (3 charges: buyer platform + marketplace + seller platform):
- Gross revenue: $18.98
- Stripe fees: $1.46 (7.7%)
- Net revenue: $17.52 (92.3%)

**Impact**: ~$146/day at 100 trades/day

## üöÄ **Bottom Line**

**This is a CRITICAL business requirement** that fundamentally enables LocalEx to be a sustainable business. The documentation is comprehensive, the technical approach is sound (Stripe), and the revenue projections are compelling.

**HOWEVER**, this MUST have:
1. ‚úÖ Legal approval (App Store compliance)
2. ‚úÖ Financial compliance validation
3. ‚úÖ Security audit (PCI scope validation)

**Recommendation**: Proceed with Phase 2 planning, but **DO NOT write payment code** until legal and financial reviews are complete.

**Estimated Timeline**:
- Legal review: 1-2 weeks
- Financial review: 1-2 weeks
- Can proceed in parallel with Slice 1-2 (no payment)
- Ready to implement by Slice 2.5 (Week 5)
