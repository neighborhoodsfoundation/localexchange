## üìã **Phase 1.4 Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1.4 - AWS S3 Storage Integration + E2E Testing Framework**
**Priority**: High - Complete the data layer foundation and testing framework

**Planned Components**:
1. **S3 Setup**: Configure AWS S3 storage and CDN integration
2. **Image Processing**: Implement image upload, processing, and optimization
3. **Storage Management**: Set up storage lifecycle and cost optimization
4. **Security**: Implement secure file access and permissions
5. **Testing**: Create comprehensive storage functionality tests
6. **E2E Testing Framework**: Implement end-to-end testing framework (pending from Phase 1.3)
7. **Documentation**: Complete S3 setup and operational documentation
8. **Narrative**: Create implementation narrative explaining the approach

### **Expected Deliverables**
